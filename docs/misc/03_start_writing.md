# Started trying to have a writing habit
I started acquiring process of a writing habit.
I will write down why and how in this article.

This article is unnecessary who don't have any psychological impedance in writing document.

## Writing habit might be a really good investment
The reason of trying to write document frequently is that I'm required to write in many situations, in my work, when contributing to OSS, when writing some blogging services. Imagine your everyday, if you are software engineer, you write comment, document, chat everyday, even your code is like natural language, because the code should be self-descriptive.

The advantages of practicing writing are

* One can be transform a thought into a text faster and all the activity above will be more efficient.
* One is forced to organize the thought in the process of writing the document.

However, I really hate writing, so I decided forcefully imposed myself writing daily.

## How to continue this habit?
Firstly I put a goal, because empirically having a meaningful exciting goal makes you work hard on the goal. You can put any goal you want to achieve by writing, but I put a goal of writing a technical book and writing a paper. 

Next thing is divide the big goal to smaller goal. The sub goal is writing the 1500 words per a day. This corresponds to 3 pages for a paper.
So this will correspond to a one book in 2 months. 

To achieve 1500 words per day, it is actually a bit hard for the people who hate writing a document. So one trial I did is starting from writing a short notes for a while and write a 1500 words totally. This short note is still meaningful to write because it has two these outcomes 

* It allow me to leave small ideas in more organized way.
* It is still a practice for writing a note
* These text can be used as a small text between main chapters. 

## How to practice and grow writing skill?
So by writing a document, the another goal of "writing a better document" is described more clearly by

1. Use words more precisely to avoid misunderstanding and make readers easier to understand
2. Write document faster by knowing new words, new way of sentence construction, new expressions
3. by getting used to the expressions.

Third goal can be achieved by just writing. First and second goal seems needs some other methods to achieve.

The method I adopted is that refining the document.
My goal is writing a technical book and a paper, so refining process is necessary when trying to integrate it to the book. This process give me an opportunity to learn new expression and correct the wrong usage of the words.

## More in detail?
So how can we do that more in detail?

There are multiple ways of doing this but I decided to write a document in markdown format and used vscode as an editor because vscode is my favorite editor and the customization for writing editor is really easier than other editors like emacs. (Emacs was my favorite editor before. I was too lazy maintaining emacs config for different environment)
There are extension to write markdown efficiently and even extension to count words.

Other tool that can be useful is DeepL.
The translation tool is really well translate text and can be used like this. 

* Write sentence in your mother language and translate the sentence to English and check if some new words or expression has appear. 
* Translate sentence in English into your mother language and check if there's strange expression in it.

## Takeaway
Takeaways are

* To practicing writing document might be a good investment
* To practice document, write document daily might be useful
* To achieve habit, setting a goal and divide sub goals to a daily unit might motivate you more.
* Some type of improvement cycle is necessary to improve skill.
